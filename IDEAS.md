Deeper and deeper - RPG/Roguelike, you are a dwarf, having to go deep into your own mines to save your mine.
Leave something behind - RPG, strict inventory which means you have to choose which items to bring and replace. Could be a story where you have to make tought choices, but yeah.
Parasite - Strategy/RTS, you are the parasite taking over X.
Shelter - Action/Survival, gather, build and survive. Mazing?!
Expansion - RTS/4X, silly strategy game with resource collection and army building.
Hidden world - RPG, storytelling about a world unseen/unknown.
Delivery - Strategy/Logistical, manage buses/trucks whatever getting at the right spot on time. Dealing with issues on the way. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ8kzpWQ0IQ). It could break down and needs tools, if it has it; it can repair. else you have to send another truck, etc.
You are the power source - Puzzle, introduce different gameplay elements like being able to charge things, connect to circuits, lay circuits, etc. Navigate your way through different levels.
Generations - RPG, items "are alive?" and can evolve. Like levels? I dunno.
One tool, many uses - RPG, magical journey to learn to use your wand?
Automation - Manual labour (resource gathering, smelting/crafting, etc?) can be automated, slowly expanding your power.
Lost signal - Storytelling, alien outpost / military FOB, scout team out there; we lose connection. Tell that story. OR! (by Aiis); radio operator in either of these ideas, where we have to figure out what's up. (by Chrispins): Something about ants and pheromones.
One time use - Puzzle, gameplay elements like flipping/rotating/changing color/inverting etc?
Containment - RTS/Turnbased/Boardgame - Virus containment, prisoners, cold war (RTS?). 
Split in two - Platformer or RPG? Split a character in two and control either or both at the same time. RPG as a Jekyll & Hyde kinda thing (potions prevent the change), goals change when personality switches. Forced scrolling platformer, where the personality switch changes the direction. 
Summoning - Puzzle (bij gebrek aan beter), patience like; we have a puzzle (literal puzzle) but you can only use the pieces you can summon. Once you summon more, the unused ones are gone unless they are connected properly.
