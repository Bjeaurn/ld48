# Todo
- Get UI to work properly, have some dialog to steer the story and game.
- Endgame, a way to finish the game.
- Content, content, content.

## Polishing ideas
- oktwtf suggested: Darker edges as you get deeper, to give a subtle indication of how deep you are (and an idea what level you are at!)
- Transitions between levels? Fade to black / some audio of a ladder?
- Movement polishing, we can rotate depending on the movement; but I'm not sure about the collision detection in that case.
